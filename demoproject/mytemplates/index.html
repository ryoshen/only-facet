<h3>This is a demo of OnlyFacet - a faceted search engine.</h3>
This project is based on my thesis - A graph based approach for solving cold-start problem in facet search. Key-word based search engines requier user have a cerntain level of domain-knowledge, which is hard for new user to query complecated target. My proposal is to use faceted search to help users detect and realize their high-level behaviors.<br/><br/>
To achive this goal, I change the nomarl usage of faceted search - remove search bar, which means users can only use facets to figure out what they want. Right now, this project or website works fine. And I will improve part of the algorithms such as weighted-graph and priority queue to filter search results set. <br/><br/>
From tech view, I built this website using Django and MySQL, and a lot of jQuery to polish the front end.
